# 🌐 Personal Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio website — a space where I combine **Data Science**, **Web Development**, and **Photography** to tell stories through both code and visuals.  

This portfolio is built with **pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, no frameworks — lightweight, responsive, and customizable.
